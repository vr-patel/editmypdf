        <h2>Free to use</h2>
        <p>
          You can use {PRODUCT.name} for anything, personal or commercial, as often as you like. There is no
          plan to buy, no trial that runs out, no watermark and no limit on documents, pages or file size
          beyond what your browser can hold in memory.
        </p>

        <h2>Provided as is</h2>
        <p>
          {PRODUCT.name} is offered as it is, without a warranty of any kind. We work hard to make every edit
          come out right, but we cannot promise the editor is free of mistakes or that it will suit every
          PDF. Check the file you download before you rely on it. The file you opened is never modified, so
          your original is always there to go back to.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent the law allows, the people who make {PRODUCT.name} are not liable for any loss that
          comes from using it.
        </p>

        <h2>Open source, MIT licence</h2>

          . That licence lets you use, copy, change and share the code, and it is also the source of the
          "as is" wording above. MIT covers {PRODUCT.name}'s own code only; third-party assets carry
          their own licences.

        <h2>Your files stay yours, and stay on your device</h2>

          A PDF you open is read, edited and rewritten inside your browser tab. It is not uploaded, and we
          never see it. Documents you keep between visits live in your browser's own storage on your device.
          Everything in them, and everything you make with {PRODUCT.name}, belongs to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the editor only on documents you are allowed to change. That is your responsibility, not
          something the editor can check.

        <h2>Comparisons with other products</h2>
        <p>
          The <Link to={ROUTES.compare}>comparison pages</Link> name other PDF editors only to compare them.
          Their names and logos belong to their owners and are shown only to identify the product. The facts on those pages were read from each vendor's own
          pages on the date shown, with links to the sources; if one is out of date, please{" "}
